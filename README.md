It is a system that has computer hardware with software embedded in it as one of its important components. Its software embeds in ROM (Read Only Memory). It does not need secondary memories as in a computer. Examples of Embedded Systems include: -> Audio system, Fax machine, Oven, Printer, Televison, Traffic Management, Security system, Ultra sound machine and soon...
In this repostory, I have attached twon projects: 0 to 99 counter and Multiple traffic light signal programmed using Embedded C.
